PyBank summarize the financial data and outputs essential parts of analysis such as number of oberservation, in this case months, and net profit/also along with average change occured, greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits over those number of observations.

This script requires the input data file to be formatted in a specific order with months as first value and here profit/loss as second value seprated by a comma. it could be another delimiter instead of a commas but then script will require a minor change to perform the analysis.

Pypoll main.py file showcase the results in terminal and create an output file in analysis folder in PyBank folder.
